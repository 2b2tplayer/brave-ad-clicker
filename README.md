my fork? just made the image detection better and translated some explanations

# BTW don't use brave, use firefox instead


# brave-ad-clicker

- Brave (https://brave.com/) is a web browser that rewards users with cryptocurrency BAT tokens for viewing ads
- This Python program uses the pyautogui library to detect a Brave ad popup, which will then open and close the ad, returning the cursor to the previous location uninterrupted
- Meant to be used during active computer use, Brave Browser is able to detect human vs machine interactions to prevent ad farming
